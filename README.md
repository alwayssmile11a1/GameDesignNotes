## Theories of fun for game design
* Games are puzzles to teach patterns, in a safe environment with low risk
* Fun arises from learning and mastering
* Different people are suited for different games 
* The more rigidly constructed your game is, the more limited it will be
* We receive dopamine when we learn something or master a task. We are evolutionarily programmed to enjoy this
* Every game is destined is to become boring
* it’s impossible for any game to appeal to everyone

## Game building blocks – “ludemes” – form the core of successful games
* Preparation
  * Before facing a challenge, make choices that affect odds of success.
  * Without this, we say it relies on chance
* Sense of space
  * Landscape of relationships between objects or players
* Solid core mechanic
  * The intrinsically interesting rule set or puzzle to solve
  * Often involves estimating probability, matching, balancing, classifying
* Range of challenges
  * Content – operates within the rules, does not change the rules
* Range of abilities
  * Many games reveal abilities over time, until at the end you have many possible strategems to choose from
  * Higher difficulty levels may require utilizing multiple abilities
* Skill required in using the abilities
  * Bad execution leads to failure in the challenge
  * Without a skill curve, the game becomes tedious
* Variable feedback
  * Result shouldn’t be predictable; greater skill should lead to better rewrads
* Failure must have a cost
  * At the least, an opportunity cost, or requiring another try
  * In more extreme, you start all over again (eg a roguelike)
  
***The holy grail is a game that provides never ending challenges, varied skills, the difficulty curve is perfect and constantly adjusts to your skill level. (AKA life)***

## The dressing on games
* Games use fictional metaphors to add variations (eg narrative), but the metaphor is often ignored by players to focus on the underlying pattern
* The best test of a game’s fun is playing with no graphics, music, sound, or story. If this is fun, then all the dressing will amplify
* The visual representation and metaphor are still part of the experience
* A mismatch between the core of the game and the dressing can result in experience problems


## 5 main ways to generate a (new) game idea 
* Copy
* Copy and modify
* Combine
* New idea
* New system

## Other ways to generate game ideas
* Consider extreme constraints – “make a one button game”
* Try not to focus too much on other games for inspiration

## Opinions on designing a game
* Satisfying
* Random but fair
* Additional elements
* Good rewards

## Level design tips
* Illusion of freedom: Even if your environment is linear, give the player options of how they want to approach various sections of your level
* **Set the pace and anticipation: Make it easy for players to get through first parts of the map then introducing more challenges, calm before the storm**
* Make it imperfect: because nothing is perfect
* Cliches: you can avoid cliches, but maybe creating and improving upon cliches is better
* **Foreshadowing: showing, indicating an upcoming event or location. For example, put up obstacles so the player can only see new section of the map but cannot go through** 
* **Previous location: the opposite of foreshadowing**
* Believable world boundaries: Block-off the non-playable areas using obstacles without calling attention to them to make the world seem bigger
* Visual tension atmosphere: Add tension to your level by using fog, haze, smoke, fire, rain, etc
* **Scripted events: Show the player the enviroment is alive and changing. For example, a bridge explodes right before the player's eyes and force the player to go other paths rather than providing them with an already-exploded bridge.**
* Interactive environment: Make enviroment interactable
* **Guide with light: guide players subconsciously to proper locations of your level by using lights, using higher ground or using props. In short, make the locations stand out rather than using UI arrows.**
* **Create relationships: For example, if giving players something, then take them away. The pain of loss is greater than motivation to gain.**
* **Re-introduction and before/after: Re-introducing a previous location to create a connection with the player (locations should have different elements, for example, they are destroyed now)**
* Water and waterfall: because they are interesting.
